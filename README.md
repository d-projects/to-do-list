a# to-do-list

A simple web app of a to-do list. Available online <a href = "http://dulhan-todo.herokuapp.com/">here.</a>

A user can add a new to-do task, check off a task as finished, un-check off a task, and delete a task. The program saves the user's tasks so that closing and re-opening the browser doesn't delete any to-do data.

Below is a screenshot of what it looks like with a few tasks added.
